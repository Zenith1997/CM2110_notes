The probability of event E is usually denoted by \\(P(E)\\). Mathematically, the function \\(P(.)\\) is a set function defined from sample space \\((\\Omega)\\) to \\([0, 1]\\) interval, satisfying the following properties. These are called the ‘axioms of probability’. Axiom 1: For any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A) \\geq 0\\) Axiom 2: \\(P(\\Omega) = 1\\) Axiom 3: If \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k\\) is a finite collection of mutually exclusive events, then \\[P(A_1\\cup A_2\\cup \\dots \\cup A_k)= \\sum_{i=1}^kP(A_i)\\] If \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots\\) is an infinite collection of mutually exclusive events, then \\[P(A_1\\cup A_2\\cup \\dots)= \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty P(A_i)\\] NOTE Axioms 1 and 2 imply that for any event \\(E\\), \\(0 \\leq P (E) \\leq 1\\). \\(P (E) = 1 \\iff\\) the event E is certain to occur. \\(P (E) = 0 \\iff\\) the event E cannot occur. Methods for determining Probability There are several ways for determining the probability of events. Usually we use the following methods to obtain the probability of events. Classical method Relative frequency method (Empirical approach) Subjective method Using probability models 1.1 Random Variable Some sample spaces contain quantitative (numerical) outcomes, others contain qualitative outcomes. Often it is convenient to work with sample spaces containing numerical outcomes. A function that maps the original sample space into the real numbers is called a ‘random variable’. This is more useful when the original sample space contains qualitative outcomes. Definition 1: Random Variable Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a sample space. Let \\(X\\) be a function from \\(\\Omega\\) to \\(\\Re\\) (i.e. \\(X:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\Re\\)). Then \\(X\\) is called a random variable. A random variable assigns a real number to each outcome of a sample space. In other words, to each outcome of an experiment or a sample point \\(\\omega_i\\), of the sample spaces, there is a unique real number \\(x_i\\), known as the value of the random variable \\(X\\). The range of the random variable is called the induced sample space. A note on notation: Random variables will always denoted with uppercase letters and the realized values of the random variable (or its range) will be denoted by the corresponding lowercase letters. Thus, the random variable \\(X\\) can take the value \\(x\\). Each outcome of a sample space occurs with a certain probability. Therefore, each possible value of a random variable is associated with a probability. Any events of a sample space can be written in terms of a suitably defined random variable. 1.1.1 Types of Random Variables A random variable is of two types Discrete Random Variable Continuous Random Variable 1.1.1.1 Discrete Random Variable If the induced sample space is discrete, then the random variable is called a discrete random variable. Example 01 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin. Express the following events using a suitably defined random variable \\(H=\\) The event of getting a head \\(T=\\) The event of getting a tail Example 02 Consider the experiment of rolling of a die. Express the following events using a suitably defined random variable \\(A=\\) The event that the number faced up is less than 5 \\(B=\\) The event that the number faced up is even \\(C=\\) The event that the number faced up is 2 or 5 Example 03 Consider the experiment of tossing a coin 10 times. Then the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) contains \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) outcomes. Each outcome is a sequence of 10 H’s and T’s. Express the following events in terms of a suitably defined random variable. \\(D=\\) The event that the number of heads is 5 \\(E=\\) The event that the number of tails is less than 4 1.1.1.2 Continuous Random Variable If the induced sample space is continuous, then the random variable is called a continuous random variable. Example 04 Consider the experiment of measuring the lifetime (in hours) of a randomly selected bulb. Express the following events in terms of a suitably defined random variable. \\(F=\\) The event that the lifetime is less than 300 hours \\(G=\\) The event that the lifetime is 1000 hours 1.2 Probability Mass Function Definition 2: Discrete density function of a discrete random variable If \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable with distinct values \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n, \\dots,\\) then the function, denoted by \\(f_X(.)\\) and defined by \\[\\begin{equation} f_X(x) = \\begin{cases} P(X=x) &amp; \\text{if } x=x_j, j=1,2,\\dots,n,\\dots\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } x \\neq x_j \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] is defined to be the discrete density function of \\(X\\). The values of a discrete random variable are often called mass points. \\(f_X(x)\\) denotes the mass associated with the mass point \\(x_j\\). Probability mass function discrete frequency function and probability function are other terms used in place of discrete density function Probability function gives the measure of probability for different values of \\(X\\). 1.2.1 Properties of a Probability Mass Function Let \\(X\\) be a discrete random variable with probability mass function \\(f_X(x)\\). Then, For any \\(x\\in \\Re\\), \\(0\\leq f_X(x) \\leq 1.\\) Let \\(E\\) be an event and \\(I= \\{X(\\omega):\\omega \\in E\\}.\\) Then \\(P(E) = P(X\\in I) = \\sum_{x \\in I}f_X(x).\\) Let \\(R = \\{X(\\omega):\\omega \\in \\Omega\\}.\\) Then \\(\\sum_{x\\in \\Re} f_X(x) = 1.\\) 1.2.2 Representations of Probability Mass Functions Example 05 Consider the experiment of tossing a fair coin. Let \\[\\begin{equation} X = \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\text{if the outcome is a Tail }\\\\ 1 &amp; \\text{if the outcome is a Head} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Find the probability mass function of \\(X\\). Is \\(X\\) discrete or continuous? 1.2.2.1 Using a table 1.2.2.2 Using a function 1.2.2.3 Using a graph 1.3 Probability Density Function Let \\(X\\) be a continuous random variable. Then, it is not possible to define a pmf \\(f_x\\) with properties mentioned in Section . Why? Instead, we can find a function \\(f_x\\) with the some different properties. Probability density function (pdf) of a continuous random variable is a function that describes the relative likelihood for this random variable to occur at a given point. 1.3.1 Properties of a Probability Density Function Let \\(X\\) be a continuous random variable with probability density function \\(f_x\\). Then, For any \\(x\\in \\Re\\), \\(f_X(x) \\geq0\\). Let \\(E\\) be an event and \\(I= \\{X(\\omega):\\omega \\in E\\}.\\) Then \\(P(E) = P(X\\in I) = \\int_If_X(x)dx.\\) Let \\(R = \\{X(\\omega):\\omega \\in \\Omega\\}.\\) Then \\(\\int_\\Re f_X(x)dx= 1.\\) 1.3.2 Existence of pdf To see the existence of such a function, consider a continuous random variable \\(X\\), Suppose that we have a very large number of observations, \\(N\\), of \\(X\\), measured to high accuracy (large number of decimal places). consider the following grouped frequency table and the histogram constructed from those data. The height of the bar on a class interval of this histogram is equal to the relative frequency per unit in that class interval. Interval Class boundaries Class frequency Height of the bar Area of the bar \\(I_1\\) \\(x_1 -\\delta x/2, x_1+\\delta x/2\\) \\(n_1\\) \\(\\frac{n_1}{\\delta x*N}\\) \\(\\frac{n1}{N}\\) \\(I_2\\) \\(x_2 -\\delta x/2, x_2+\\delta x/2\\) \\(n_2\\) \\(\\frac{n_2}{\\delta x*N}\\) \\(\\frac{n2}{N}\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(\\vdots\\) \\(I_k\\) \\(x_k -\\delta x/2, x_k+\\delta x/2\\) \\(n_k\\) \\(\\frac{n_k}{\\delta x*N}\\) \\(\\frac{nk}{N}\\) Total Figure 1.1: Histograms with different class intervals and a possible model for the pdf Then, for the \\(i^{th}\\) interval, \\[P(x_i - \\frac{\\delta x}{2} \\leq X \\leq x_i + \\frac{\\delta x}{2}) \\approx \\text{Area of the bar} \\] and therefore \\[\\text{Height of the bar} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Area of the bar}}{\\delta x} \\approx \\frac{ P(x_i - \\frac{\\delta x}{2} \\leq X \\leq x_i + \\frac{\\delta x}{2})}{\\delta x} \\] Therefore, the height of a bar represents the probability density in that class interval. When \\(\\delta x \\rightarrow0\\), it will allow us to approximate the histogram by a smooth curve as in Figure (d). As the area under each histogram is 1, the area under the curve is also 1 For any point \\(x\\), \\[\\text{The height of the curve} \\approx \\lim \\limits_{\\delta x \\to 0} \\frac{P(x_i-\\frac{\\delta x}{2} \\leq X \\leq x_i+\\frac{\\delta x}{2})}{\\delta x} \\] will represent the the probability density at point \\(x\\). Let the above smooth curve be denoted by \\(f_X\\). Then, \\(f_X\\) has the properties mentioned in Section . The function is called the probability density function of \\(X\\). NOTE Here \\(f_X(x)\\) represents Probability density at point \\(x\\). Not Probability at point \\(x\\). 1.3.3 Calculation of Probability using pdf Let \\(c,d \\in \\Re\\) such that \\(c\\leq d\\). Then, \\[P(c\\leq X \\leq d) = \\int_c^d f_X(x)dx\\] Figure 1.2: \\(P(c\\leq x \\leq d = \\int_c^d f_X(x)dx\\) NOTE: if \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable with the p.d.f \\(f_X\\), then for any \\(k \\in \\Re\\), \\[P(X=k) = P(k\\leq X\\leq k)=\\int_k^kf_X(x)dx = 0\\] Therefore, for a continuous random variable \\(X\\), \\[P(c&lt;X&lt;d) = P(c\\leq X&lt;d) = P(c &lt; X\\leq d)= P(c \\leq X\\leq d)= \\int_c^df_X(x)dx\\] 1.4 Cumulative Distribution Function There are many problems in which it is of interest to know the probability that the values of a random variable is less than or equal to some real number \\(x\\). Definition 3: Cumulative distribution function The cumulative distibution function or \\(cdf\\) of a random variable \\(X\\), denoted by \\(F_X(x)\\), is defined by \\[F_x(x) = P(X\\leq x), \\text{ for all } x \\] Therefore, if \\(X\\) is a discrete random variable, the cdf is given by, \\[F_X(x)=\\sum_{t\\leq x}f_X(t), \\text{ } -\\infty &lt; x&lt;\\infty\\] where \\(f_X(t)\\) is the value of the pmf of \\(X\\) at \\(t\\). 1.4.1 Relationship between cdf and pdf If \\(X\\) is a continuous random variable, the cdf is given by, \\[F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x}f_X(t)dt \\text{ } -\\infty &lt;x&lt;\\infty\\] where \\(f_X(t)\\) is the value of the pdf of \\(X\\) at \\(t\\). (Here \\(t\\) is a dummy integration variable). Conversely, \\[f_X(x)= \\frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}\\] Example 06 An owner of a software engineering company is interested in knowing how many years his employees stay with his company. Let \\(X\\) be the number of years an employee will stay with the company. Over the years, he has established the following probability distribution: \\(x\\) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \\(f_X(x) = P(X=x)\\) 0.1 0.05 0.1 ? 0.3 0.2 0.1 Find \\(f_X(4)\\) Find \\(P(X&lt;4)\\) Find \\(P(X\\leq4)\\) Draw the probability mass function of \\(X\\) Draw the cumulative distribution function of \\(X\\) 1.4.2 Properties of a cumulative distribution function of a Discrete random variable Example 07 \\[\\begin{equation} f_X(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{25}x &amp; 0\\leq x &lt; 5\\\\ \\frac{2}{5}- \\frac{1}{25}x &amp; 5\\leq x \\leq 10\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Find the CDF of \\(X\\) Find \\(P(X\\leq 8)\\) Find \\(P(3\\leq X\\leq 8)\\) 1.5 Expectations and Moments 1.5.1 Expectation The expected value, or expectation of a random variable is merely its average value. By weighting the values of the random variable according to the probability distribution, we can obtain a number that summarizes a typical or expected value of an observation of the random variable. Definition 4: Expected value Let \\(X\\) be a random variable. The expected value or mean of a random variable \\(g(X)\\), denoted by \\(E[g(x)],\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} E[g(x)] = \\begin{cases} \\sum_{x}g(x) f_X(x) &amp; \\text{if } X \\text{ is a discrete random variable with pmf } f_X(x) \\\\ \\int_x g(x) f_X(x)dx &amp; \\text{if } X \\text{ is a continuous random variable with pdf } f_X(x) \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] The mean of a random variable gives a measure of central location of the density of \\(X\\). The process of taking expectations is a linear operation. For any constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\[E(aX+b) = aE(X)+b\\] 1.5.1.1 Properties of expected value Theorem \\(E(c) = c\\) for a constant \\(c\\) \\(E[cg(X)] = cE[g(X)]\\) for a constant \\(c\\) \\(E[c_1g_1(X)+c_2g_2(X)]= c_1E[g_1(X)]+c_2E[g_2(X)]\\) If \\(g_1(x) \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x\\), then \\(E[g_1(X)] \\geq 0\\) If \\(g_1(x) \\geq g_2(x)\\) for all \\(x\\), then \\(E[g_1(X)] \\geq E[g_2(X)]\\) If \\(a\\leq g_1(x) \\leq b\\) for all \\(x\\), then \\(a\\leq E[g_1(X)] \\leq b\\) If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are two independent random variables, then \\(E(X \\times Y) = E(X)\\times E(Y)\\) Example 08 Random variable \\(X\\) has the following pmf \\[\\begin{equation} f_X(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.2 &amp; x =2\\\\ 0.3 &amp; x =4\\\\ 0.4 &amp; x =5\\\\ 0.1 &amp; x =7 \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Find \\(E(X)\\) Find \\(E(X^2)\\) Find \\(E\\left( \\frac{1}{X}\\right)\\) Find \\(E(2X+3X^2-5)\\) 1.5.2 Moments The various moments of a distribution are an important class of expectation Definition 5: Moments If \\(X\\) is a random variable, the \\(r\\)th moment of \\(X\\), usually denoted by \\(\\mu_r^\\prime,\\) is defined as \\[\\mu_r^\\prime = E(X^r).\\] if the expectation exists. Note that \\(\\mu_1^\\prime = E(X)= \\mu,\\) the mean of \\(X\\). Definition 6: Central moments If \\(X\\) is a random variable, the \\(r\\)th central moment of \\(X\\) about \\(a\\) is defined as \\(E[(x-a)^r]\\). If \\(a= E(X) = \\mu,\\) we have the \\(r\\)th central moment of \\(X\\), about \\(E(X)\\), denoted by \\(\\mu_r,\\) which is \\[\\mu_r=E[(X-E(X))^r] = E[(X-\\mu)^r] .\\] Find \\(\\mu_1\\) Definition 7: Variance If \\(X\\) is a random variable, \\(Var(X)= E[(X-E(X))^2]= E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2\\) provided \\(E(X^2)\\) exists. The variance of a random variable \\(X\\) is its second central moment, \\(Var(X) = E[(X-E(X))^2]= E[(X-\\mu)^2]\\) The positive square root of \\(Var(X)\\) is the standard deviation of \\(X\\) The variance of a random variable gives a measure of the degree of spread of a distribution around its mean. Let \\(X\\) be a random variable, and let \\(\\mu\\) be \\(E(X).\\) the variance of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(\\sigma^2\\) of \\(Var(X),\\) is defined by \\[\\begin{equation} Var(X) = \\begin{cases} \\sum_{x}(x-\\mu)^2f_X(x) &amp; \\text{if } X \\text{ is discrete with mass points } x_!, x_2, \\dots, x_j\\dots \\\\ \\int_x (x-\\mu)^2 f_X(x)dx &amp; \\text{if } X \\text{ is continuous with probability density function } f_X(x) \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] 1.5.2.1 Properties of variance of a random variable Theorem If \\(c\\) is a constant, then \\(V(cX) = c^2V(X)\\) \\(V(c) = 0\\), Variance of a constant is zero. If \\(X\\) is a random variable and \\(c\\) is a constant, then \\(V(c+X) = V(X)\\) If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constants, then \\(V(aX+b)= a^2V(X)\\) If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are two independent random variables, then \\(V(X+Y) = V(X) + V(Y)\\) \\(V(X-Y) = V(X) + V(Y)\\) 1.6 Models for Discrete Distributions 1.6.1 Discrete Uniform Distribution A random variable \\(X\\) has a discrete uniform \\((1, N)\\) distribution if \\[f_X(x)= P(X=x)=\\frac{1}{N}, \\;\\; x=1,2,\\dots, N\\] where \\(N\\) is a specified integer. The distribution puts equal mass on each of the outcomes \\(1,2,\\dots, N.\\) If \\(X\\) ha s a discrete uniform distribution, then \\(E(X) = (N+1)/2\\) and \\(Var(X) = (N^2-1)/12.\\) 1.6.2 Bernoulli Distribution Bernoulli Trial A random experiment of which the outcome can be classified into two categories is called a Bernoulli trial In general, the results of a Bernoulli Trial are called ‘success’ and ‘failure’. We denote these results by \\(S\\) and \\(F\\), respectively. Consider a Bernoulli trial. Let \\[\\begin{equation} X= \\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\text{if the Bernoulli trial results in a failure } \\\\ 1 &amp; \\text{if the Bernoulli trial results in a success} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Suppose that the probability of a ‘’success’ in any Bernoulli trial is \\(\\theta.\\) Then \\(X\\) is said to have a Bernoulli distribution with probability mass function \\(f_X(x)= P(X=x)=\\theta^x(1-\\theta)^{1-x}, \\;\\;x=0,1\\) This is denoted as \\(X \\sim Bernoulli(\\theta).\\) If \\(X\\) has a Bernoulli distribution, then \\(E(X) = \\theta\\) and \\(Var(X) = \\theta(1-\\theta)\\) 1.6.3 Binomial Distribution A random experiment with the following properties is called a ‘Binomial experiment’ The random experiment consists of a sequence of \\(n\\) trials, where \\(n\\) is fixed in advance of the random experiment. Each trial can result in one of the same two possible outcomes: “success” \\((S)\\) or “failure” \\((F)\\) The trials are independent. Therefore the outcome of any particular trial does not influence the outcome of any other trial. The probability of “success” is the same for each trial. Let this probability is \\(\\theta.\\) Binomial distribution Consider a binomial experiment with \\(n\\) trials and probability \\(\\theta\\) of a success. A random variable \\(X\\) is defined to have a binomial distribution if the discrete density function of \\(X\\) is given by \\[f_X(x)= P(X=x)= {n\\choose x}\\theta ^x(1-\\theta)^{n-x} , \\;\\; x=0,1,2,\\dots, n\\] This is denoted as \\(X \\sim Bin(n,\\theta).\\) If \\(X\\) has a binomial distribution, then \\(E(X) = n\\theta\\) and \\(Var(X) = n\\theta(1-\\theta)\\) The binomial distribution reduces to the Bernoulli distribution when \\(n=1.\\) 1.6.4 Geometric Distribution Consider a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials whose probability of “success” for each trial is \\(\\theta\\). Let \\(X= \\text{Number of failures before the first success}\\) Then, \\(X\\) is said to have a Geometric distribution with parameter \\(\\theta.\\) The probability mass function is given by \\[f_X(x)= P(X=x)= \\theta (1-\\theta)^x , \\;\\; x=0,1,2,\\dots\\] This is denoted as \\(X \\sim Geometric(\\theta).\\) If \\(X\\) has a geometric distribution, then \\(E(X) = (1-\\theta)/\\theta\\) and \\(Var(X) = (1-\\theta)/\\theta^2\\) A random variable \\(X\\) that has a geometric distribution is often referred to as a discrete waiting-time random variable. It represents how long (in terms of number of failures) one has to wait for a “success.” 1.6.5 Negative Binomial Distribution Consider a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials whose probability of “success” for each trial is \\(\\theta\\). Let \\(X= \\text{Number of failures before the rth success}\\) Then, \\(X\\) is said to have a Negative Binomial distribution with parameter \\(\\theta.\\) The probability mass function is given by \\[f_X(x)= P(X=x)= {x+r-1\\choose r-1} \\theta^r (1-\\theta)^x , \\;\\; x=0,1,2,\\dots\\] This is denoted as \\(X \\sim negbin(r,\\theta).\\) If \\(X\\) has a Negative Binomial distribution, then \\(E(X) = r(1-\\theta)/\\theta\\) and \\(Var(X) = r(1-\\theta)/\\theta^2\\) If in the negative binomial distribution \\(r=1\\), then the negative binomial density specializes to the geometric density. 1.6.6 Hypergeometric Distribution Suppose a population of size \\(N\\) has \\(M\\) individuals of a certain kind (“success”). A sample of \\(n\\) items is taken from this population without replacement. Let \\(X\\) be the number of successes in the sample. Then, \\(X\\) is said to have a hypergeometric distribution. The probability mass function is given by \\[f_X(x)= P(X=x)= \\frac{{M\\choose x}{N-M\\choose n-x}}{{N \\choose n}} , \\;\\; x=0,1,2,\\dots, n\\] Hypergeometric distribution can be used as a model for the number of “successes” in a sample of size \\(n\\) if the sampling is done without replacement from a relatively small population. If \\(X\\) has a Hypergeometric distribution, then \\(E(X) = n.\\frac{M}{N}\\) and \\(Var(X) = n\\frac{M}{N}\\left(1-\\frac{M}{N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N-n}{N-1}\\right)\\) 1.6.7 Poisson Distribution The Poisson distribution provides a realistic probability model for the number of events in a given period of time, space, region or length. Example: The number of fatal traffic accidents per week in a given city The number of emails per hour coming into the company of a large business the number of defect per unit of some material Poisson distribution is suitable if the following conditions hold. the number of events within non-overlapping time intervals are independent. Let \\(t\\) be a fixed time point. For a small time interval \\(\\delta t\\), the probability of exactly one event happening in the interval \\([t,t+\\delta t]\\) is approximately proportional to the length \\(\\delta t\\) of the interval. i.e., \\[\\frac{P(\\text{exactly one event in }[t,t+\\delta t])}{\\delta t} \\to \\text{a positive constant}\\] as \\(\\delta t \\to 0.\\) Let \\(t\\) be a fixed time point. For a small time interval \\(\\delta t\\), the probability of more than one event happening in the interval \\([t,t+\\delta t]\\) is negligible. i.e., \\[\\frac{P(\\text{more than one event in }[t,t+\\delta t])}{\\delta t} \\to 0\\] as \\(\\delta t \\to 0.\\) Let \\(X\\) be the number of events during a time interval. Suppose that the average number of events during the interested time interval is \\(\\lambda (&gt;0).\\) Then, the distribution of \\(X\\) can be modeled by a Poisson Distribution with the probability mass function, \\[f_X(x)= P(X=x)= \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} (\\lambda)^x}{x!} , \\;\\; x=0,1,2,\\dots\\] - This is denoted as \\(X \\sim Poisson(\\lambda).\\) If \\(X\\) has a Poisson distribution, then \\(E(X) = \\lambda\\) and \\(Var(X) = \\lambda\\) The Poisson distribution can be used for counts of some sort of a given area, space, region, volume or length as well. Example 09 Phone calls arrive at a switchboard at an average rate of 2.0 calls per minute. If the number of calls in any time interval follows the Poisson distribution, then \\(X =\\) number of phone calls in a given minute. \\(X \\sim Poisson(\\; )\\) \\(Y =\\) number of phone calls in a given hour. \\(Y \\sim Poisson ( \\;)\\) \\(W =\\) number of phone calls in a 15 seconds. \\(W \\sim Poisson (\\;)\\) 1.7 Models for Continuous Distributions 1.7.1 Uniform Distribution The continuous uniform distribution is defined by spreading mass uniformly over an interval \\([a,b]\\). A random variable \\(X\\) is said to have a uniform distribution in \\((a,b)\\) if its probability density function is given by \\[f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a};\\; a\\leq x\\leq b\\] This is denoted as \\(X\\sim U(a,b)\\) or \\(X \\sim Unif(a, b)\\) It is easy to check \\(\\int_a^bf(x) dx =1\\). We also have \\[E(X) = \\int_a^b\\frac{x}{b-a}dx = \\frac{a+b}{2}\\] \\[Var(X) = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\\] Figure 1.3: Uniform probabiity density 1.7.2 Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution) One commonly used bell shaped curve is called the normal distribution. Many techniques use din applied statistics are based upon the normal distribution. The normal distribution has two parameters, usually denoted by \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\), which are its mean and variance. A random variable \\(X\\) is said to have a normal distribution with location parameter \\(\\mu\\) and scale parameter \\(\\sigma\\), if its probability density function is given by, \\[f_X(x)=f_X(x;\\mu, \\sigma)= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2};\\;\\; -\\infty&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\] This is denoted by \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). The normal density function is symmetric around the location parameter \\(\\mu\\). The dispersion of the distribution depends on the scale parameter \\(\\sigma\\). If \\(X\\) is a normal random variable, \\(E(X) = \\mu\\) and \\(Vax(X) = \\sigma^2\\) Figure 1.4: Normal distribution for different \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) Figure 1.5: \\(P(a&lt; X &lt; b = \\int_a^b f_X(x)dx\\) \\[P(a&lt;X&lt;b)=\\int_a^b \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}dx\\] Evaluating of this integration is somewhat tedious When we calculate this type of probabilities of normal distribution manually, it is convenient to use a normal probability table. 1.7.2.1 Standard Normal Distribution Normal distribution with \\(\\mu =0\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1\\) is called the standard normal distribution. A random variable with standard normal distribution is usually denoted by \\(Z\\). The probability density function of standard normal distribution is denoted by \\(\\phi\\) If \\(Z\\sim N(0,1)\\), then \\[\\phi_Z(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}z^2};\\;\\; -\\infty&lt; z&lt; \\infty\\] Probabilities related to Z can be found by using standard normal probability table.

The normal distribution is somewhat special as its two parameters \\(\\mu\\) (the mean) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) (the variance), provide us with complete information about the exact shape and location of the distribution. Straightforward calculus shows that the normal distribution has its maximum at \\(x=\\mu\\) and inflection point (where the curve changes from concave to convex) at \\(\\mu \\pm\\sigma.\\) 1.7.3 Gamma Distribution We come across with many practical situations in which the variable of interest has a skewed distribution. The gamma family of distributions is a flexible family of distributions on \\([0,\\infty)\\) that yields a wide variety of skewed distributions A random variable \\(X\\) is said to have a gamma distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and scale parameter \\(\\beta\\) if its probability density function is given by \\[f_X(x;\\alpha, \\beta)= \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\beta ^ {\\alpha}}x^{\\alpha-1}e^{-x/\\beta}, \\;\\; 0&lt;x&lt;\\infty,\\;\\; \\alpha &gt;0, \\;\\;\\beta &gt;0\\] Here \\(\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\) is called the gamma function, \\[\\Gamma(\\alpha)=\\int_0^{\\infty}x^{\\alpha-1}e^{-x}dx\\] - The gamma function satisfies many useful relationships, in particular, \\(\\Gamma(\\alpha+1)=\\alpha\\Gamma(\\alpha),\\;\\; \\alpha &gt;0\\) (can be verified through integration by parts) \\(\\Gamma(1) =1\\) For any positive integer \\(n(&gt;0)\\), \\(\\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!\\) \\(\\Gamma \\left (\\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\pi}\\) When \\(X\\) has a gamma distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and scale parameter \\(\\beta\\), it is denoted as \\(X \\sim gamma(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) The parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is known as the shape parameter, since it most influences the peakedness of the distibution The parameter \\(\\beta\\) is called the scale parameter, since most of its influence is on the spread of the distribution. Figure 1.8: Gamma density functions If \\(X\\) has a gamma distribution with shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and scale parameter \\(\\beta\\), then \\(E(X) = \\alpha \\beta\\) \\(Var(X) = \\alpha \\beta^2\\) 1.7.4 Exponential Distribution This distribution is often used to model lifetime of various items. When the number of events in a time interval has a Poisson distribution, the length of time interval between successive events can be modeled by an exponential distribution. A random variable \\(X\\) is said to have an exponential distribution with scale parameter \\(\\beta\\), if its probability density function is given by \\[f_X(x; \\beta)=\\frac{1}{\\beta}e^{-x/\\beta},\\;\\; 0&lt;x&lt;\\infty\\] This is denoted by \\(X \\sim exponential(\\beta)\\) Figure 1.9: Exponential density functions Note that exponential distibution is a special case of the gamma distribution. It can be easily shown that \\(X\\sim exponential(\\beta) \\iff X\\sim gamma (1.\\beta)\\) If \\(X\\) has an exponential distribution, then \\(E(X) = \\beta\\) \\(Var(X) = \\beta^{2}\\) 1.7.5 Beta Distribution The beta family of distributions is a continuous family on \\((0,1)\\) indexed by two parameters. The \\(beta(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) probability density function is \\[f_X(x; \\alpha, beta)= \\frac{1}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)}x^{\\alpha -1}(1-x)^{\\beta-1},\\;\\;0&lt;x&lt;1,\\; \\alpha &gt;0,\\;\\; \\beta &gt;0,\\] where \\(B(\\alpha, \\beta)\\) denotes the beta function, \\[B(\\alpha, \\beta)=\\int_0^1x^{\\alpha -1}(1-x)^{\\beta-1}dx.\\] The beta function is related to the gamma function through the following identity \\[B(\\alpha, \\beta)= \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}\\] The beta distibution is one of the few common “named” distributions that give probability 1 to a finite interval, here taken to be \\((0,1)\\). Therefore, the beta distibution is often used to model proportions, which naturally lie between 0 and 1. Figure 1.10: Beta density functions 1.8 Approximations 1.8.1 Poisson approximation to Binomial Suppose \\(X\\sim Bin(n, \\theta)\\) and \\(n\\) is large and \\(\\theta\\) is small. Then \\(X\\sim Poisson(n\\theta)\\) and \\[f_X(x) \\approx \\frac{e^{-n\\theta} (n\\theta)^x}{x!}\\] Example 16 Suppose \\(X\\) has a binomial distribution with \\(n=40\\) and \\(p=0.005\\). Find \\(f_X(1)\\) 1.8.2 Normal approximation to Binomial Suppose \\(X\\sim Bin(n, \\theta)\\) and \\(n\\theta \\geq 5\\) and \\(n(1-\\theta) \\geq 5.\\) Then \\(X \\sim N(n\\theta, n\\theta(1-\\theta))\\) and \\[P(X \\leq x)_{Binomial} = P(X \\leq x + 0.5)_{Normal} \\approx P(Z \\leq \\frac{x+0.5-n\\theta}{\\sqrt{n\\theta(1-\\theta)}})\\] Note: Since we are approximating a discrete distribution by a continuous distribution, we should apply a continuity correction Example 17 Suppose \\(X\\) has a binomial distribution with \\(n=40\\) and \\(p=0.6.\\) Find \\(P(X\\leq 20)\\) \\(P(X &lt; 25)\\) \\(P(X &gt; 15)\\) \\(P(X \\geq 20)\\) \\(P(X = 30)\\) 1.8.3 Normal approximation to Poisson Suppose \\(X\\sim Poisson(\\lambda)\\) and \\(\\lambda &gt; 10,\\) \\[P(X \\leq x)_{Poisson} = P(X \\leq x + 0.5)_{Normal} \\approx P(Z \\leq \\frac{x+0.5-\\lambda}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}})\\] Note: Since we are approximating a discrete distribution by a continuous distribution, we should apply a continuity correction Example 18 Suppose \\(X\\) has a Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda=25\\) \\(P(X\\leq 20)\\) \\(P(X &lt; 25)\\) \\(P(X &gt; 15)\\) \\(P(X \\geq 20)\\) \\(P(X = 30)\\) 1.9 Distribution of Functions of Random Variables Distribution of the linear transformation of a normal random variable Suppose that \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2).\\) Let \\(Y= ax+b,\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constants.

["estimations.html", "Chapter 2 Estimations 2.1 Statistical Inference 2.2 Point Estimation 2.3 Interval Estimation Tutorial", " Chapter 2 Estimations 2.1 Statistical Inference The process of making educated guess and conclusions regarding a population, using a sample of that population is called Statistical Inference. Two important problems in statistical inference are estimation of parameters and tests of hypothesis Estimation can be of the form of point estimation and interval estimation. 2.2 Point Estimation Main Task Assume that some characteristic of the elements in a population can be represented by a random variable \\(X\\). Assume that \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) is a random sample from a density \\(f(x, \\theta)\\), where the form of the density is known but the parameter \\(\\theta\\) is unknown. The objective is to construct good estimators for \\(\\theta\\) or its function \\(\\tau (\\theta)\\) on the basis of the observed sample values \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\) of a random sample \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) from \\(f(x, \\theta)\\). Definition: Statistic Suppose \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) be \\(n\\) observable random variables. Then, a known function \\(T=g(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\) of observable random variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) is called a statistic. A statistic is always a random variable. Definition: Estimator Suppose \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) is a random sample from from a density \\(f(x, \\theta)\\) and it is desired to estimate \\(\\theta\\). Suppose \\(T=g(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\) is a statistic that can be used to determine and approximate value for \\(\\theta\\). Then \\(T\\) is called an estimator for \\(\\theta\\). An estimator is always a random variable. Definition: Estimate Suppose \\(T=g(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\) be an estimator for \\(\\theta\\). Suppose that \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\) is a set of observed values of the random variable \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n.\\) Then the value \\(t=g(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)\\) obtained by substituting the observed values in the estimator is called an estimate for \\(\\theta\\). Therefore the estimator stands for the function of the sample, and the word estimate stands for the realized value of that function. Notation: An estimator of \\(\\theta\\) is denoted by \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). An estimate of \\(\\theta\\) is also denoted by \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\). The difference between the two should be understood based on the context. Parameter Estimator: Using random sample (\\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\)) Estimate 1: Using observed sample (\\(1,4,2,3,4\\)) Estimate 2: Using observed sample (\\(4,2,2,6,3\\)) \\(\\mu\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{X}\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\) \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\) \\(\\sigma^2\\) \\(\\hat{\\sigma^2}=S^2\\) \\(\\hat{\\sigma^2}=\\) \\(\\hat{\\sigma^2}=\\) 2.2.1 Methods of finding point estimators In some cases there will be an obvious or natural candidate for a point estimator of a particular parameter. For example, the sample mean is a good point estimator of the population mean However, in more complicated models we need a methodical way of estimating parameters. There are different methods of finding point estimators Method of Moments Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) Method of Least Squares Bayes Estimators The EM Algorithm However, these techniques do not carry any guarantees with them The point estimators that they yeild still must be evaluated before their worth is established 2.2.1.1 Method of Moments Let \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots X_n\\) be a random sample from a population with pdf or pmf \\(f(x; \\theta),\\) where \\(\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\dots, \\theta_k)\\) and \\(k\\geq 1\\). Sample moments \\(m^\\prime\\) and population moments \\(\\mu^\\prime\\) are defined as follows Sample moment Population moment \\(m_1^\\prime= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\) \\(\\mu_1=E(X)\\) \\(m_2^\\prime= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^2\\) \\(\\mu_2=E(X^2)\\) \\(\\dots\\) \\(\\dots\\) \\(m_k^\\prime= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^k\\) \\(\\mu_k=E(X^k)\\) \\(\\dots\\) \\(\\dots\\) Each \\(\\mu_j^\\prime\\) is a function \\(\\theta,\\) i.e. \\(\\mu_j^\\prime= \\mu_j^\\prime(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\dots, \\theta_k)\\) for \\(j=1,2,\\dots, k.\\) Method of Moments Estimators (MME) We first equate the first \\(k\\) sample moments to the corresponding \\(k\\) population moments, \\[m_1^\\prime = \\mu_1^\\prime,\\] \\[m_2^\\prime = \\mu_2^\\prime,\\] \\[\\dots\\] \\[m_k^\\prime = \\mu_k^\\prime,\\] Then we solve the resulting systems of simultaneous equations for \\(\\hat{\\theta_1}, \\hat{\\theta_2}, \\dots, \\hat{\\theta_k}\\) 2.2.2 Methods of evaluating point estimators 2.3 Interval Estimation 2.3.1 Interpretation of confidence intervals 2.3.2 Methods of finding interval estimators 2.3.3 Methods of evaluating interval estimators Tutorial Let \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n \\sim iid\\;\\; N(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\\) both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) unknown.

The survival time (in weeks) of 20 randomly selected male mouse exposed to 240 units of certain type of radiation are given below. \\(152, 115, 109, 94, 88, 137, 152, 77, 160, 165, 125, 40, 128, 123, 136, 101, 62, 153, 83, 69\\) It is believed that the survival times have a gamma distribution.
